# Example use of the Computable Bibliography

The following images were generated using the Computable Bibliography. 
The DOI file used for generation can be downloaded below; it is taken from a workshop
held by the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine in August 2020 on airborne
transmission of SARS-CoV-2. [Workshop page viewable here.](https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/airborne-transmission-of-sars-cov-2-a-virtual-workshop#sectionPublications)
