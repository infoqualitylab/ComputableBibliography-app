# Example use of the Computable Bibliography

The following images were generated using the Computable Bibliography. 
<a id="raw-url" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/infoqualitylab/ComputableBibliography-app/refs/heads/main/COVID-CB-example.txt"> Download the DOI file used for generation</a>; 
it is taken from an August 2020 workshop held by the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine on airborne
transmission of SARS-CoV-2. [Workshop page viewable here.](https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/airborne-transmission-of-sars-cov-2-a-virtual-workshop#sectionPublications)

These visualizations give insight into the overall recency of the topic under investigation, as well as the wide variety of
journals cited and disciplines represented. Overall, this exemplifies recent, still-fluctuating knowledge creation.

### Limitations and notes for this example
This example does not include any publications without a DOI, which were cited at this conference, because those 
publications are un-queryable via OpenAlex. As previously noted, there are also time series implications for this conference. 
It took place in August 2020, so more recent publications are not included.
