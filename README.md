Description

This app retrieves information for a list of publications based on their Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) using OpenAlex. The input is a .txt file; the output is multiple python dictionaries comparing publication information and multiple plots to visualize trends. The file also measures DOIs that return no information from OpenAlex.
